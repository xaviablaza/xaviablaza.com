`master` branch is what is deployed on xaviablaza.com
`dev` branch is the development branch for new additions or changes

Some ideas I'd like to build:
- Business card app with link redirects that give you push notifications and reminders to follow-up with someone
- CSAFE, but using stellar to manage payments
- Discord [Google Assistant Bot](https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/voice#project-overview)
- Quality Management Systems, documentary tracking systems, Basic HR automation software, project management tools. Basic sets of tools for an organization slowly creeping into the modern world, like Philippine LGUs. Possibly using stellar.
- Docker/Kubernetes deployment of a full validating stellar-core node and horizon instance
- [Chapman Radio](https://github.com/pollend/chapmanradio) on rails
- UXSoc website theme using hugo
- Greener Pastures, using stellar
- Stellar SaaS (?) something like what corelogic does to sell data and get data from local barangays, schools, something like that
- [Helios frontend](https://helios.cssninja.io/), ruby on rails backend with [solidus](solidus.io) as an ecommerce website, using coins.ph as payments gateway
